![Natalya Kosenko](/assets/india_team.jpg)

Hi, my name is Natalya. Originally from Russia, I've been working in Southeast Asia since 2010: Thailand, then Singapore plus occasional work trips to Indonesia and India. 

Many people know me as a Product Manager who enjoys working with developers and knows how to translate developer speak into business speak and vice versa. But deep in my heart (not so deep actually) I am a programmer. At the end of 2016 I've got a fixed idea to transition from manager to developer. Of course I am full of doubts: isn't it too late? will I be just a mediocre developer? will I like it more than product management? But anyway, time will tell.

In this blog I write about what interests me. Rigth now my major interest is coding, so most of the posts are about coding. Hope you'll find something useful/inspiring here, and thanks for reading.
